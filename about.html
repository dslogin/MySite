                    <p class="example">The frontend of a website is everything that a user sees and can interact with using a browser. Creating this visual part is called frontend development. Designers who create user interfaces can also be called frontend developers in some sense, because they work together on the same part of the project. To develop a frontend, the following basic tools are used: HTML (to create the basic structure of pages and content), CSS (to style the appearance) and JavaScript (to add interactivity). The same set of tools is used in the process of creating progressive web applications - mobile applications that look like native, but are created with the participation of frontend technologies.</p>

                <div class="html">
                    <h2>HTML</h2>
                    <div class="photo">
                        <img src="img/html.jpg" height="345">
                    </div>
                    <p class="example">HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is a hypertext markup language for text. It is needed to place elements on a web page: text, pictures, tables and videos. When you visit the site, the browser loads an HTML file with information about the structure and content of the web page. HTML builds the visual foundation of the site, but does not "launch" the site on its own. It just indicates where the elements are located, what their basic design will be, where to get styles for elements and scripts (usually they are written in JavaScript).</p>

                <div class="css">
                    <h2>CSS</h2>
                    <div class="photo">
                        <img src="img/css.jpg" height="345">
                    </div>
                    <p class="example">CSS (Cascading Style Sheets, cascading style sheets) is a language for describing the appearance of an HTML document. This is one of the basic technologies in the modern Internet. Almost no website is complete without CSS, so HTML and CSS work in a single bundle.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="js">
                    <h2>JavaScript</h2>
                    <div class="photo">
                        <img src="img/js.jpg" height="345">
                    </div>
                    <p class="example">JavaScript is a language for managing elements on a website. He can paint buttons, run animations, load effects, and all this without reloading the page. For example, you clicked the "Like" button — a red heart flashed. Or you put the cursor on three points, and the menu fell out. In both cases, the script worked on the page. And JavaScript is just the main one for them on the Internet — hence its name.</p>
